This folder contains what we will consider a "hello world" configuration for the full `ufs2arco + Anemoi + wxvx` pipeline.

You will be able to create a training dataset consisting of 1 year of NOAA Replay reanalysis, train a graph-based model, run inference, and finally verification on some forecasts.

There are configurations for running this set up in the following locations:
- Perlmutter
- Ursa
- AzureML

The scripts and config files to submit jobs in each location are found in the respective folders.
