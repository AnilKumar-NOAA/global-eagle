Update path to your miniconda in `submit_training.sh`

Run:
`sbatch submit_training.sh`

Feel free to just let this run until you get a checkpoint saved out and then cancel. For the purposes of getting this workflow finished we just need a checkpoint to move onto the next step.

Checkpoints will be saved in `outputs/` folder during training.
